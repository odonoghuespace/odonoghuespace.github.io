# Welcome!

I am a planetary scientist and astronomer in the [Space and Atmospheric Electricity Group (SPATE)](https://research.reading.ac.uk/met-spate/) group at the University of Reading. My research focuses on our Solar System’s giant planets and their interactions with their space environments. I have returned to the UK following 10 years living internationally, working for NASA, the Japanese space agency (JAXA) and Boston University.

### Research Interests
- **Astronomy of Giant Planets**: Using the world's largest telescopes to observe Jupiter and Saturn.
- **Aurorae of Jupiter and Saturn**: Investigating the processes that drive the stunning auroras on these Gas Giants.
- **Destruction of Saturn's Rings**: Exploring the mechanisms behind the disappearance of Saturn's iconic rings.

### Science Communication
In addition to my academic work, I’m passionate about making complex astronomical concepts accessible to everyone. In my spare time, I create [educational videos](https://www.youtube.com/@Interplanetary) that explain the vast scales, motions, and mechanisms that shape our solar system and beyond. 

### Consultant Work
I am also a regular science and media consultant, working with the likes of the BBC, Encyclopedia Britannica, Japan's state broadcaster NHK and more.
