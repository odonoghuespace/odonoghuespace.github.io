## Academic Background

### JAXA Institute of Space and Astronautical Science: Fellow  
*May 2019 - October 2023*  
**Research aims:** Mapping Jupiter's ionospheric parameters, attempts to detect an exoplanetary ionosphere, and continued monitoring of Saturn's ring rain.  
**Summary:** Produced global maps of Jupiter's ionospheric parameters showing heat redistribution from the auroral regions. Preliminary work on detecting the ionosphere of an exoplanet. Conducted first attempts to observe the charged water product, H₃O⁺, in Saturn's ionosphere.

### NASA Goddard Space Flight Center: Fellow  
*January 2017 - March 2019*  
**Research aims:** Spacecraft-supporting observations of Jupiter & the effects of ring rain at Saturn.  
**Summary:** Supported Juno mission with infrared aurora observations at Jupiter. Led the study that re-detected Saturn’s ring rain, estimating the decay and lifetime of Saturn’s rings (~300 million years).

### Boston University: Research Scientist  
*May 2014 - January 2017*  
**Research aims:** Planet-wide investigations of Jupiter and Saturn's ionosphere.  
**Summary:** Discovered that Jupiter’s Great Red Spot heats the atmosphere above it. Studied auroral behaviors at Saturn and ionosphere dynamics at both Jupiter and Saturn.

### University of Leicester: Ph.D. in Planetary Space Science  
*October 2010 - May 2014*  
**Thesis:** The response of gas giant ionospheres to their local space environments.  
**Supervisor:** Dr. Tom Stallard  
**Summary:** Observed Saturn and Jupiter's infrared emission lines to detect the H₃⁺ molecular ion. Discovered the "ring rain" phenomenon at Saturn.

### University of Wales, Aberystwyth: B.Sc. in Planetary and Space Science, First-class honors  
*September 2006 - June 2010*  
**Dissertation:** A Study of Lunar Impact Flashes  
**Supervisor:** Dr. Anthony Charles Cook  
**Summary:** Used two telescopes to observe lunar impact flashes caused by meteoroid collisions.
