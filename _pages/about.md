I'm a planetary scientist in the [Department of Meteorology](https://research.reading.ac.uk/meteorology/ "Department of Meteorology") and a member of the [Space and Atmospheric Electricity Group (SPATE)](https://research.reading.ac.uk/met-spate/). My research interests are:

* Astronomy of Giant Planets
* The aurorae of Jupiter and Saturn
* The destruction of Saturn's rings
* Solar wind affects at Jupiter and Saturn

In my spare time I make [videos]([https://youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/@Interplanetary)) which explain the scales, motions and mechanisms of the solar system and beyond.
