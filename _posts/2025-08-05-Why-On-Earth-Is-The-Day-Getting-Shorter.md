Earth will complete a rotation 1.33 milliseconds earlier than usual on Tuesday, August 5. That makes it one of the shortest days of 2025 at 86,399.99867 seconds long. How that happens, and how we can even measure it with such precision, might make your head spin faster too.

On average, Earth physically rotates in 23 hours, 56 minutes, 4 seconds and 90.5 milliseconds – this is called a **sidereal day**, Earth’s “true” rotation relative to distant deep-space objects like stars.

However, the kind of day we use in daily life is 24 hours long – a **solar day** – the time between two sunrises or consecutive noons. The 4-minute difference comes from Earth needing to rotate slightly more than 360° for the Sun to appear in the same place again.

Both kinds of day are slightly shorter on August 5, 2025. This is largely due to influences such as:

- Winds in the atmosphere
- Ocean circulation
- Magma movement
- The Moon's tidal effects

Thanks to **atomic clocks** and astronomical tracking, deviations from 24 hours have been measured since the 1970s. For instance, in 1973, Earth lagged by +1.106 seconds, requiring the addition of **leap seconds** – a whole extra second at 23:59:60 – to keep clocks in sync with Earth's rotation.

GPS systems require extreme timing precision. A 1.33 ms error could throw off GPS by 62 cm at the equator. If left uncorrected over a year, 1973’s cumulative drift could have introduced GPS errors of around **half a kilometre**.

## Why doesn’t the Earth stay still?

To measure Earth’s rotation, we compare its spin to fixed points in deep space. The most effective reference points? **Quasars**.

Quasars are ultra-luminous black holes, visible billions of light years away, and appear stationary due to their immense distance. By tracking Earth’s motion relative to them using **radio telescopes**, scientists can measure rotation to **sub-millisecond precision**.

These measurements feed into [Earth orientation models](https://www.iers.org/IERS/EN/DataProducts/EarthOrientationData/eop.html) that account for:

- Atmosphere
- Oceans
- Celestial motions
- Internal core dynamics

This modeling allows scientists to forecast day-length changes well in advance – critical for correcting navigation systems.

### Seasonal influences on Earth's spin

Winds are the biggest daily influence. When winds strike mountains, they transfer energy and actually **slow Earth’s spin**. In the northern hemisphere, wind speeds are slowest during **June to August**, which leads to the **shortest days** (even though they have the most daylight).

Other seasonal and longer-term effects include:

- **Melting polar ice** redistributing water toward the equator, increasing Earth’s moment of inertia and **slowing the rotation**.
- **Earthquakes** shifting mass and altering spin rate.
- The **Moon** constantly dragging Earth's oceans backward, steadily sapping angular momentum and increasing day length over geologic time.

## The Moon is slowing Earth down

Tidal forces from the Moon create ocean bulges that Earth drags ahead as it rotates. The Moon then pulls back on those bulges, creating a drag force.

This slows Earth’s spin but transfers angular momentum to the Moon, which is now **moving away at 3.8 cm per year**.

Over billions of years, this has lengthened our day – from about **17 hours** 2.5 billion years ago to today’s 24-hour standard.

## A twist in recent years

From 1973 to 2020, Earth’s rotation **slowed every year**. But since 2020, it's been **speeding up**, probably due to **angular momentum exchange between Earth’s core and mantle**.

Still, the effect of the Moon, wind, seasons, and internal planetary motion continue to create minor, measurable variations. For example, **July 5, July 22, and August 5** of 2025 were predicted to be the shortest days due to optimal alignment of these effects.

You won’t notice the sunrise arriving 1.33 milliseconds earlier – but the atomic clocks and quasars certainly will.
